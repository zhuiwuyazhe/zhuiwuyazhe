## Hello, I'm Lishuo Dong.

I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Nanjing University of Science and Technology in China.

- 🔭 I am researching the numerical problems of partial differential equations with divergence-free or curl-free conditions.
- 🌱 I am currently studying topics such as meshless numerical algorithms, Python, and machine learning.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with meshless numerical algorithms in MATLAB.
